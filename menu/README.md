# react-projects

Collection of small React JS projects including a CRUD app, color shades visualizer, lorem-ipsum generator, slider and so on...

These projects are completed by myself while following John Smilga's React course on Udemy. HTML and CSS structures are inspected via using Dev Tools in browser on projects' online websites. From there, I have tried to figure out how to combine current HTML/CSS with React Code and implemented project's required functionality. If you wonder original codes of these projects, please visit the course owner's repo below.
